ðŸŽ® Dreadvale: The Whisperplague

In the cursed land of Dreadvale, the veil between worlds has rotted away. A mysterious plague whispers through the fogâ€”infecting minds, warping beasts, and resurrecting nightmares. Every sunrise brings fragile hope. Every nightfall awakens the horrors that crawl just beyond sight.Roam a procedurally generated open world twisted by darkness. Fight spectral horrors, mutated beasts, and corrupted souls. Scavenge, survive, and uncover the truth of the Whisperplague. Youâ€™re aloneâ€”or so you think.

Will you defy the darkâ€¦ or surrender to it?

â€œLight fades. Dread remains".ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
